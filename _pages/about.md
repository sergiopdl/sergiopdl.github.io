My name is Sergio Ponce de Leon.
I am a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/graduate-programs/prospective-graduate-students/phd-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognitive and Information Sciences</a> at the University of California, Merced.
My research interests include consciousness science, philosophy of mind, and artificial intelligence.
I use experimental, philosophical, and computational approaches.
My current research projects include:
1. [Measuring conscious contents using EEG complexity](/project/2025-05-08-Detecting-differences-in-conscious-contents-using-EEG-complexity-measures)
2. [Philosophical analysis of integrated information theory (IIT)](/project/2025-06-06-Integrated-information-theory-(IIT)-and-the-testability-of-the-silent-neuron-predictions)
3. [Testing IIT using transcranial magnetic stimulation](/project/2025-06-08-Does-brain-activity-cause-consciousness-a-tms-experiment)
4. Societal impacts of conscious AI

My dissertation (in preparation) is titled: Consciousness, complexity, and silent neurons: Philosophical and empirical investigations for integrated information theory (IIT).
My dissertation advisor is <a href="https://jeffyoshimi.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Yoshimi</a>.

Before starting my PhD, I studied Human-Computer Interaction, data visualization, and applied machine learning at the University of Michigan <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-science-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Information</a>, and I was a Senior Director of UX & Product Management for a <a href="https://pmatechnologies.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suite of project management software applications</a> at <a href="https://pmaconsultants.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PMA Consultants</a>.
