<h2>My academic and professional journey</h2>
I started my higher education journey studying <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/pite/majors/environment-major.html" target="_blank">environmental science</a> at the University of Michigan, specializing in urban and environmental planning. The program provided foundations in ecology, geology, biology, and chemistry, as well as social-scientific and philosophical approaches to addressing many types of environmental problems. I also dabbled in a few computer science courses after having been captivated by <a href="https://eecs183.github.io/eecs183.org/" target="_blank">an introductory programming course in C++</a>. However, it was an episode of NOVA on PBS about monkeys controlling computers with their thoughts via brain-computer interfaces that fascinated me the most. At the time, I didn't really think I was smart enough to study something like neuroscience or biomedical engineering, so I continued my day-to-day studies.

For the next 10+ years, I worked in various roles in software development for <a href="https://pmaconsultants.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a construction management consulting firm</a> that started their own <a href="https://pmatechnologies.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-house software development operation</a>. From technical writing, to UI design, to digital marketing, to customer support, I wore a lot of hats.

In 2015, I decided to pursue a Master's degree part-time in Human-Computer Interaction, data visualization, and applied machine learning at the University of Michigan <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-science-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Information</a> (UMSI). As a result, my role at PMA Consultants expanded to become responsible for UX research, product management, innovation strategy, recruiting, and managing UI/UX design- and UI engineering direct reports. However, my coursework at UMSI in applied cognitive psychology and machine learning got me thinking again about more fundamental topics related to mind, brain, and behavior. The nail in the coffin turned out to be another PBS series called <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/brain-david-eagleman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Brain</a> (with Neuroscientist David Eagleman), which explores topics such as perception, decision-making, control, personality, and reality itself. I decided to apply to PhD programs in Cognitive Science in order pursue research in consciousness and artificial intelligence.

I'm currently a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/graduate-programs/prospective-graduate-students/phd-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognitive and Information Sciences</a> at the University of California, Merced, using [experimental](/categories/empirical), [philosophical](/categories/philosophical), and [computational](/categories/computational) approaches to study consciousness and artificial intelligence. My dissertation advisor is <a href="https://jeffyoshimi.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Yoshimi</a>. You can see my research projects [here](/projects).
