excerpt: "In this paper, we first review how IIT’s axiomatic framework has evolved through the latest version (4.0), and why the theory takes such an approach.
We then analyze this approach through the lens of Husserlian phenomenology, finding support for both IIT's axiomatic approach in general, and for all of IIT's individual axioms."

Integrated information theory (IIT) is a scientific theory of consciousness that proposes mathematics-based explanations for both the presence vs. absence of experience, as well as for the qualitative nature of experience. Rather than starting from what is known about the behavioral or neural correlates of consciousness (which is more typical among neuroscientific theories of consciousness), IIT takes an axiomatic approach. By starting from introspection, phenomenology, and reason, IIT first identifies a set of essential properties of experience (“axioms”), and then infers corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions for a physical entity to be conscious (“postulates”). IIT’s axioms have been criticized for not being axiomatic, and for failing to impose substantive constraints. In this project, we first review how IIT’s axiomatic framework has evolved through the latest version (4.0), and why the theory takes such an approach. We then analyze IIT’s axioms through Husserlian phenomenology. In our analysis, we describe each of IIT’s axioms, and we provide examples from the writings of Husserl that support or contradict each axiom. We conclude with a discussion of how the field of phenomenology is a rich resource for contemporary theories of consciousness, whether or not they take an axiomatic approach.
